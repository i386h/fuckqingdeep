## 满清简史

满清的历史带着人肉的血腥味，他们是人类历史上最黑暗最歹毒的统治者，让中世纪欧洲相形见绌。

### 吃人

满清三百年，就是个大型缅北。甚至更夸张。人吃人现象两百多起，且八旗军和各个托克索庄园把人肉纳入补给范畴。清初，满军攻破城池就捕捉老百姓的子女囚禁在笼中，又让这些人的父母拿着破门板去向明军冲锋当炮灰，女性作为性奴，最后把他们一起杀掉当作肉吃。大量明军士兵因此精神攻击而精神失常，有败将用手敲地，硬生生是把双手敲碎了。有记载明军在满军守城区域找到一顿多他们吃人肉剔除不要的女性外阴约一吨多，堆积如山。

后来，他们在各地修建满城用于养育贵族，又在城外修建柳叶边城墙，将汉人野化，纵容田庄捕捉汉人和各族人民为奴，为了防止逃跑先是砍掉双脚，后来改成裹脚。西班牙等航海国有大量记载他们以极低价格，长期不断地销售中国人奴隶，这些人普遍受伤严重，存活率不到70%。广州十三行有资料记载出口大量尸油给暹罗等周边国家，清朝长期出口人类骨头等各种产品。

### 杀人

满清针对蒙古族，白族，苗族，回族等各族人民展开空前惨烈的大屠杀。这其中因为对准噶尔汗国的战争旷日持久，才有很多故事流传下来，他们会边打边攻击平民，强奸别人家里的女性，杀掉别人家里的男性，再让女人用这些肉来做菜给他们吃。满清统治期间被杀掉的人大概有一亿到一亿两千万之多。最后准噶尔汗国被完全消灭，不再有这个民族。

### 禁言

满清实行了人类历史上最严苛的文字狱，大量的人因为批判朝廷或者只是被怀疑有反心就被杀害。篡改史书，整理出四库全书但是其历史研究价值很低。

### 偷钱

满清签了3000多个条约，相当于向全世界转移了资产，并后续不断利用这些钱财贿赂中国的官员。重新给自己谋求影响力。

### 叛国

满清与日本人联手制造了731，南京大屠杀等。打开城门让日本人毫不费力拿到吉林乃至东北。后续他们跟日本人通婚，想联手消灭以汉族为核心的中华民族。

### 复辟

满清一直在等待机会复辟，时至今日，他们还致力于美化自己，把自己的族人送进各种文化，文艺，教育产业，致力于抢夺共和国口舌，想在未来找机会夺取政权。

## China Qing Dystany History

The history of the Manchu Qing dynasty is tinged with the stench of human flesh and blood. They were the darkest and most vicious rulers in human history, making medieval Europe pale in comparison.

### Cannibalism

The Manchu Qing Dynasty, spanning three hundred years, was essentially a large-scale Burma (modern-day northern Myanmar). It was even more extreme. There were over two hundred cases of cannibalism, and the Eight Banners army and various Toksog estates included human flesh in their supplies. In the early Qing Dynasty, when the Manchu army breached cities, they captured the children of civilians and imprisoned them in cages. Their parents were then forced to use broken door panels as cannon fodder in the Ming army's attacks. Women were used as sex slaves, and ultimately, they were all killed and eaten. Many Ming soldiers suffered mental breakdowns due to this, with one defeated general smashing his hands against the ground. Records indicate that the Ming army found over a ton of discarded female genitalia in the Manchu-held areas, piled up like mountains.

Later, they built Manchu cities throughout the country to house nobles, and constructed willow-leaf-shaped walls outside these cities, essentially feralizing the Han Chinese. They allowed estates to capture Han Chinese and other ethnic groups as slaves, initially cutting off their feet to prevent escape, later replacing this with foot binding. Spain and other maritime nations have extensive records documenting their long-term and continuous sale of Chinese slaves at extremely low prices. These slaves were generally severely injured, with a survival rate of less than 70%. Records from the Thirteen Factories of Guangzhou indicate the export of large quantities of corpse oil to neighboring countries such as Siam. The Qing Dynasty also exported human bones and various other products for a long period.

### Murder

The Manchu Qing dynasty carried out unprecedentedly brutal massacres against various ethnic groups, including the Mongols, Bai, Miao, and Hui. Many stories of this are attributed to the protracted war against the Dzungar Khanate; the Qing would attack civilians while fighting, raping women and killing men, then forcing the women to use the flesh to cook for them. It is estimated that between 100 and 120 million people were killed during the Qing rule. Ultimately, the Dzungar Khanate was completely destroyed, and the Dzungar people ceased to exist.

### Suppression

The Qing dynasty implemented the most severe literary inquisition in human history, killing countless people simply for criticizing the court or even just for being suspected of rebellion. They also altered historical records and compiled the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries), but its historical research value is very low.

### Theft

The Qing dynasty signed over 3,000 treaties, essentially transferring assets worldwide, and subsequently used these funds to bribe Chinese officials, thus regaining its influence.

### Treason

The Qing Dynasty, in collusion with the Japanese, perpetrated Unit 731 and the Nanjing Massacre. By opening the city gates, they allowed the Japanese to easily seize Jilin and even Northeast China. Subsequently, they engaged in intermarriage with Japanese citizens, hoping to jointly eliminate the Han-centric Chinese nation.

### Restoration

The Qing Dynasty has been waiting for an opportunity to restore its rule. Even today, they are dedicated to beautifying themselves, sending their people into various cultural, artistic, and educational industries, striving to control the Republic's discourse, and hoping to seize power in the future.
